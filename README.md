This project is a basic website with a landing page, a catalogue page and a cart page. It has 5 items . An item can be added and removed from cart. The cart calculates a total including VAT, gives delivery options and allows for a discount code. The project is my Biggest leap into coding on level 1 and can be used in my portfolio.

To install this project you need to open a terminal/command prompt. In terminal, Navigate to your desired folder by using the `cd` command. Once the folder is your main path run the `git clone` command in the following format :     `git clone URL` - then press enter. The URL to this project is : `https://github.com/tjjacobskzn/Task5-CT2`.

To use this project open the folder named "html". There will be numerous sub-folders and a single HTML file called "mainPage.html". Double click this file to run the project in an engine of your choice (like Chrome). You will start on the landing page, which says : "TJ's Flyfishing Adventures" and "Welcome to our online shop". Under these headings will be a picture of a flyfishing reel. It can be clicked on as it is the `catologue page` (all the items are on this page). On the catologue page you will have 4 option items which you can add to your `cart` by pressing the `add to cart button`, or click on each item image to `view item description` and also have the option to add to cart. On the catologue page you will notice a `back` button, which returns the user to the main page, and a `cart` icon. This `cart` icon can be clicked on to view your cart and your total `cost` of your cart. This includes `Delivery`, `discount coupon`, `VAT` and `Cart Total`. Your total will change depending on your items, delivery option and if a discount coupon is used. The discount coupon for the page is the word "hello". Once you have chosen the delivery option a `Place order` button will be activated. If you press on it your page will be alerted with "Your order was succesful" and a refference number will be generated (in this case it is hard coded). All items will be stored in localStorage.
